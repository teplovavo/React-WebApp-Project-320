Book Finder

Welcome to Book Finder, a simple app I built to help people find books easily and learn more about them. It's built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and useReducer for state management. It was a really fun project that helped me learn a lot, and I hope you enjoy using it!

Technologies Used

React: The main framework used for building the UI components.
JavaScript, HTML, CSS: These are the usual suspects—handling the basics of how the app works, looks, and behaves.
Axios: Used to make API requests to Google Books.
React Responsive Carousel: Added a cool carousel to display popular books, just to make the UI a bit more interesting!

How It Works

You can search for books, see some details about them, and even add books to a cart (just for fun, we aren't actually buying anything here 😉). You can remove items from the cart, and I've added a carousel at the top with some popular books that load up right away to give you some ideas.

Features

Search Books: Type in a title, and it'll pull from Google Books' API.
Book Carousel: Shows some preloaded, popular books for quick browsing.
Book Details: Click on a book to see more information about it—like the author, description, and more.
Cart: Add and remove books to your cart. Again, this is just for fun, but it's a cool way to explore different books.
UseReducer Hook: Manages the state of the app in an effective way.

How to Use It

Clone the repo.
Run npm install to install the dependencies.
Run npm start to start the development server.
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Unsolved Problems

I want to add a real database to store user preferences and the cart items persistently.
It'd be cool to add more fancy UI components, like a filter option for genres or a user login.

What's Next?

I'm thinking of maybe adding LocalStorage so your cart items can persist even if you refresh the page. I also want to get this deployed and possibly add more interesting books to the initial carousel.


Thanks for checking it out, and feel free to fork, clone, and play around with it! 😊
